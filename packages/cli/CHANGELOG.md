## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- Add transform for default CommonJS imports when targeting ESM ([#19](https://github.com/ts-bridge/ts-bridge/pull/19), [#37](https://github.com/ts-bridge/ts-bridge/pull/37))
  - Default CommonJS imports are transformed to use a helper function which
    checks if the module has a `__esModule` property, and returns the default
    export if it does.

### Changed

- Inline shims instead of importing from `@ts-bridge/shims` ([#35](https://github.com/ts-bridge/ts-bridge/pull/35), [#36](https://github.com/ts-bridge/ts-bridge/pull/36), [#37](https://github.com/ts-bridge/ts-bridge/pull/37))
  - `@ts-bridge/shims` is now deprecated and no longer used by the tool.
  - This reduces the number of dependencies and makes the tool more
    self-contained.
- Only transform undetected named CommonJS imports ([#34](https://github.com/ts-bridge/ts-bridge/pull/34))
  - Named CommonJS imports are only transformed if they are not detected as
    exports.
    - This uses `cjs-module-lexer` to detect named exports, which is used by
      Node.js and other tools to detect named exports as well.

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- Add experimental support for project references ([#30](https://github.com/ts-bridge/ts-bridge/pull/30), [#32](https://github.com/ts-bridge/ts-bridge/pull/32))
  - If the specified `tsconfig.json` contains a `references` field, all
    referenced projects will be sorted based on their dependencies, and built.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- Add import attribute to JSON imports ([#26](https://github.com/ts-bridge/ts-bridge/pull/26))
  - This fixes compatibility with Node.js, Rollup, and other tools that do not
    support JSON imports without a `with { type: 'json' }` attribute.

### Changed

- Implement `@ts-bridge/resolver` ([#24](https://github.com/ts-bridge/ts-bridge/pull/24))
  - `@ts-bridge/resolver` implements the Node.js module resolution algorithm and
    is now used instead of the custom resolver implementation.
  - This resolves some edge cases and makes the tool more compatible with
    Node.js and other tools.

## [0.1.4]

### Fixed

- Check parent paths for `package.json` file when checking if a module is ESM ([#16](https://github.com/ts-bridge/ts-bridge/pull/16))

## [0.1.3]

### Fixed

- Fix "ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir '...'" error when using nested folders ([#14](https://github.com/ts-bridge/ts-bridge/pull/14))

## [0.1.2]

### Changed

- Bump minimum TypeScript version to 4.8 ([#12](https://github.com/ts-bridge/ts-bridge/pull/12))
  - The tool was already incompatible with TypeScript versions older than 4.8,
    but this change makes the minimum version explicit.

### Fixed

- Add transformer to remove type imports and exports ([#10](https://github.com/ts-bridge/ts-bridge/pull/10))
  - This fixes compatibility with TypeScript 4.8 and later in certain cases.

## [0.1.1]

### Added

- Add MIT license ([#2](https://github.com/ts-bridge/ts-bridge/pull/2))
  - The package was already licensed under the MIT license, but the license file
    was missing.

### Fixed

- Fix compatibility with TypeScript 4.x ([#6](https://github.com/ts-bridge/ts-bridge/pull/6))

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Initial release of the `@ts-bridge/cli` package.
