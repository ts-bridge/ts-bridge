# Fixtures

This folder contains a set of fixtures that are used in the tests of this
package. These are (partial) TypeScript projects that consist of different
files and configurations that are used to test the different features of TS
Bridge.

The fixtures are organized in subfolders, each of which contains a different
fixture. These fixtures are not meant to be complete projects, but rather
small, self-contained examples that demonstrate a specific feature or
behaviour of TS Bridge.
